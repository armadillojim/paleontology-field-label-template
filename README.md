# paleontology field label template

This repository contains templates for a business-card-sized field label.  It works well when printed on an uncoated, heavier weight paper (such as 16pt thickness).

The label has space for typical data needed when collecting paleontological specimens.  The reverse has horizontal and vertical centimeter-scale grids, an arrow for indicating north in photographs, and space for your initials.
